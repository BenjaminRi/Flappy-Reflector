## Notes

This is a JavaScript port of the original game which is written in Lua and runs on CrankStoryboard. The Lua source code can be found in the `original/` subdirectory. While Crank Storyboard is a great piece of software that runs on many operating systems, it is nonfree, so I deemed it necessary to free the original game from the shackles of its closed environment.
